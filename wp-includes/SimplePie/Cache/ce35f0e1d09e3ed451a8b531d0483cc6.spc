<p>What you call your course matters. After all, not only does your course name indicate the subject matter but like any good book, titles entice the user to learn more.</p>



<p>As you know, online audiences have short attention spans and often make snap decisions based on a quick first impression. Most folks only stay on a web page for about 15 seconds, so if the name of your course doesn’t grab their attention, they may click elsewhere for content that seems more worth their time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help you think more critically about what to call your class, we’ve gathered six reasons why we think it’s important to have this conversation about your course name.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-your-course-appears-more-professional-when-branded">Your course appears more professional when branded</h3>



<p>If you’ve named courses before, bring the title to mind: how does the name reflect on your brand? Does the phrasing, wording, imaging, and banners all show the learner what your company is about? Everyone should think of how their course reflects on their brand. By using language you would use to describe your overall company aesthetic, you’re ensuring that your course is an extension of what you offer as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-a-good-course-name-allows-for-specific-design-elements">A good course name allows for specific design elements&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The more specific and focused your course name is, the more you can use it as a design framework. For example, instead of offering an “introduction to photography” course, your customers can say they enrolled in a “photography bootcamp” or “photography academy.” That sort of branding unlocks tons of potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a bootcamp, for example, you can refer to lesson elements as “stations” where learners stop and practice a new skill. Learners can run “drills” (quizzes) to test their knowledge. With a focused, tailored title, it unlocks more potential for creative, unified, and specific course design.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-seo-best-practices-can-attract-more-users">SEO best practices can attract more users&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you hope to grow traffic to your courses organically, you should be following <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-tips-to-build-seo-strength-for-your-online-course/">SEO (search engine optimization) best practices</a>. We have some specific tips for course creation SEO from <a href="https://www.learndash.com/using-seo-to-sell-more-online-courses/">Rebecca Gill that can help you sell your courses</a>. Tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a> help you find phrases, keywords, and search terms for a course name, along with how difficult it would be to rank each option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also run potential name ideas through <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=CA">Google Trends</a>. This free service can help you identify search volume patterns as well as related search queries and topics. For example, if you search “how to vlog” in Google Trends, you’ll see the related topics are “YouTube” and “TikTok.” So, if you tailored a class especially for “how to vlog on TikTok,” you may hit a niche market where more folks will be interested in your course!&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-it-sets-you-apart-from-competitors">It sets you apart from competitors&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This is one of the most important ideas behind why it’s important to think about your course title. Potential learners need to see right in the title that what you offer differs from your competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s think back to the photography bootcamp example. If your course fully embraces this concept of a “bootcamp” then over time, your course may be known among competitors as an intensive crash course on the subject. Other interested folks will start to recognize that your course design is different than any other basic course model and will gravitate towards your course as having a perceived benefit over the competition. All of this begins with a name!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-a-course-name-has-to-mean-something">A course name has to &#8220;mean&#8221; something</h3>



<p>One big mistake in naming courses is falling into the trap of being too cute or clever. Puns, acronyms, and other turns of phrases are fun and exciting to brainstorm, but at the end of the day, they are often empty cliches that don’t mean much. Relying too much on a pun can even mislead potential learners or turn them off. Clarity should beat cleverness every time.</p>



<h3 id="h-it-sets-expectations-for-the-learners">It sets expectations for the learners&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Similar to specificity for SEO purposes, specificity in your name should also address pain points your course is going to solve. One way to think about this is to answer the question:&nbsp; “What is the value of my course?” Most often, this goes back to learning outcomes, which are the objectives you want your learners to take away from the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s think back to the vlogging example. “How to vlog,” doesn’t quite mean anything. “How to vlog on TikTok” is better, but what are learners really taking away? “From Beginner to Pro: How to vlog on TikTok” explains a bit more the value of your course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What folks are buying is a <em>transformation</em>. A great course name should set the expectation for how much work is ahead of them while also hinting at the benefits. How will your course make their lives better?&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>With these considerations in mind, we hope you agree that it’s important to think deeply about what goes into your next course name. No matter how great your content, if the name doesn’t hint or showcase this, you might never entice folks enough to check it out.</p>

<p>If you plan to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-course-pricing-models-explained/">charge a premium for your course</a>, you must ensure the experience lives up to the price tag. That could mean offering a little something extra to help students justify the cost.</p>



<p>At a minimum, your course should provide top-notch content and a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-organize-your-online-course-content/">seamless student interface</a>. But you can also include a few extras to incentivize learners to sign up for your course. Here are five options to consider if you’re looking for ways to justify a higher course price and sweeten the deal for students.</p>



<h2>1. Share downloadable bonus content.</h2>



<p>People love a useful freebie. Templates, spreadsheets, worksheets, and other <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/ideas-to-use-pdf-in-elearning">downloadable goodies</a> provide value by helping students jump-start a project or apply course lessons to their specific needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The type of freebie you offer will depend on your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-choose-a-topic-for-your-course-in-a-saturated-market/">course topic</a>. For example, if your course is about personal finance, you might give away a convenient budgeting spreadsheet to students who enroll.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. Recruit a well-known instructor.</h2>



<p>You don’t need an A-list celebrity as the face of your course, but it helps to have a recognizable and reputable instructor. Prospective students will be more willing to pay a higher price if they’re confident in the teacher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure you—or whoever is teaching your course—is respected in your field and has relevant credentials. Highlight those credentials in your course description and emphasize your street cred wherever it’s relevant.</p>



<h2>3. Offer one-on-one coaching.</h2>



<p>Sometimes, online learning can feel a little impersonal—especially if students don’t receive individual attention from the instructor. Add a personal and premium touch to your course by offering one-on-one coaching to each student who signs up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might offer a 30-minute phone session with each student, for example, or you could offer in-depth, personalized feedback on one of the course assignments.</p>



<h2>4. Create a community.</h2>



<p>For some learners, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/creating-a-robust-social-community-within-your-lms/">connecting with other students</a> is just as valuable as a qualified instructor and one-on-one coaching. Make it easy for learners to network with each other by providing a private community just for class participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can use an add-on like <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/restrict-content-pro/">Restrict Content Pro</a> to keep this community in a gated section of your website. You can also opt for a platform like Google Groups or Facebook Groups if that’s where your students prefer to interact.</p>



<h2>5. Provide certification.</h2>



<p>You can justify charging a little more for your course if it offers a worthwhile certification. This may require some extra work on your end to coordinate with the governing body or association for your industry, but it can be worth the extra effort to provide this added value to your learners—and give your course’s credibility a boost.</p>



<h2 id="h-justify-a-higher-course-price-with-learndash">Justify a higher course price with LearnDash.</h2>

<p>Emails are a valuable tool for your business. These aren’t only a way of communicating with customers, but also an excellent channel to get the word out to prospects about your services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies use email marketing to:</p>



<ul><li>Inform their customers with news and updates about the business</li></ul>



<ul><li>Attract potential clients with new service offerings and discounts</li><li>Engage readers and motivate them to get to know the brand better</li><li>Convert prospects into buyers and retain current customers</li></ul>



<p>To master your email marketing strategy, you must know how to write high-performing emails.</p>



<p>Experts agree personalization is key to building an email that engages and converts. Consider adding a unique opening to your message and multimedia elements to get customers’ attention.</p>



<p>Use storytelling or share a relatable story to make your email pleasing to the eye. Convey emotions properly over email and you’ll be one step closer to sealing the deal.</p>



<p>To end your email, try to sound friendly and professional. ‘Kind regards’ or ‘Thanks’ are proper farewell words. Remember to always add an <a href="https://newoldstamp.com/email-signature/">email signature</a> to sign off your message and be memorable.</p>

<p>The first step to organizing and promoting your online course with email marketing is to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-email-list-building-strategies-for-course-creators/">build an email list</a>.</p>



<p>On this list, you’ll add the customer&#8217;s email addresses to whom you want to sell your online course. Once you’ve done it, you can send a mass email to your contacts and get them to enroll in your training program.</p>



<p>How can you build your email list fast and from scratch? Follow these tips and upgrade your list-building strategy:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Collect emails ethically and effectively — </strong>one thing you don’t want to do when building an email list is to be intrusive. Use embedded signup forms on your website to gather visitors’ data or build a strong customer referral program.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Collect the data you need — </strong>think about what kind of information you need from your customers. Design sign-up forms accordingly and keep them short. Ask people to fill in 1-3 fields to avoid form abandonment.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Create useful content — </strong>update your content regularly and diversify your communications. Clients may get tired of receiving the same promotional email over and over again. Instead, offer them another type of content like blog articles, online courses or monthly newsletters.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Measure the results — </strong>check metrics like the click-to-open and conversion rates. Like this, you can analyze if your email marketing strategy is working as expected and how many people are subscribing to your course.</li></ul>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/img_62bb34e89fb7f.png" alt=""/></figure>

<p>To <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-price-an-online-course/">sell your online course</a> you must know how to write a killer email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s no magical formula to building a perfect email, but there are some steps you can follow to drive more conversions:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Write an eye-catching subject — </strong>create a sense of urgency and inspire curiosity in your audience. E.g., ‘Don’t miss out on a once in a lifetime opportunity to enroll in our online course’ or ‘Are you ready to change your career path?’.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Customize every email — </strong>call readers by their name, but also send them relevant content depending on their buying preferences. You can get these insights if you track your email marketing campaign performance.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Create engaging and shareable content — </strong>design a high-converting copy. You may offer the best online course ever, but if you don’t know how to sell it with words you’re lost. Use your brand’s tone of voice and be straightforward with your message.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Add a powerful CTA — </strong>drive users to take action and buy your online course. Place a CTA button or link at the end of the email to guide customers to a landing page. Command verbs like ‘subscribe’ or ‘register now’ work best.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Close the email with your email signature — </strong>be professional. An email signature shows you&#8217;re an established business and it reinforces interaction with the reader.</li></ul>



<p>If you use these hints, you’ll be one step closer to attracting customers to your online course. Your clients appreciate concision. Make sure to keep your email short and communicate your message as clearly as possible.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing can be one of the trickiest parts of launching a new course. It requires a balance between providing value to your audience and setting a price they’re willing to pay—or deciding if you’re going to charge for your courses at all.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you choose a course pricing model, it’s a good idea to compare the options and consider your revenue goals. Here are the four most common pricing models to consider as you plan and price your courses.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-1-free-courses">1. Free courses</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-free-course-content-to-drive-more-business/">Free courses</a> are a great tool to help drive business and get people interested in the content you have to offer. A free course or sample lesson can also serve as a test strategy for something you plan to evolve or further develop as a paid course later. If you’re just beginning to cultivate your audience, a free course can be a good starting point as you build up a customer base.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-baseline-courses">2. Baseline courses</h2>



<p>Baseline courses reach a wide audience by providing content that appeals to many people at an affordable price point. These should be courses that you can create relatively quickly. They also shouldn’t require a huge time commitment from students or cover topics that are too in-depth or technical. These courses may result in a lot of signups with lower participation because of the low-risk price point.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-small-font-size"><blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="https://www.learndash.com/do-low-online-course-completion-rates-matter/"><strong>Do Low Online Course Completion Rates Matter?</strong></a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>3. Premium courses</h2>



<p>Premium online courses are the goal for most content creators when they are thinking about pricing strategy. These courses have the highest price points and deliver quality, in-depth content. Course material must be unique, taught by a reputable or well-known instructor, or cover a subject that you won’t find anywhere else—these attributes help justify the premium price point.</p>



<h2>4. Subscription courses</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/should-you-use-a-subscription-pricing-strategy/">Subscription model courses</a> offer membership payment options for your customers. This can be in the form of daily, weekly, monthly, or annual subscriptions. After becoming a member, students have unlimited access to your gated course content.</p>



<p>Regardless of which pricing model you choose, how can you be sure you’re setting the right price for your courses?</p>



<h2>The formula for setting your course price</h2>



<p>Setting the price for a course isn’t an exact science, but you can use the formula below to take some of the guesswork out of pricing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-price-an-online-course/"><strong>How to Price an Online Course</strong></a></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>To get started, you’ll need a few key pieces of information.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Audience size. </strong>Take a look at your audience to determine how many people might be interested in your online course. You might start by adding up your total followers on social media or looking at the size of your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-email-list-building-strategies-for-course-creators/">email list</a>. If you’re creating a course on a niche topic, your potential audience may be a smaller segment of your larger audience. The audience size might change for every new course you create.</li><li><strong>Revenue goals. </strong>Think about <a href="https://www.learnworlds.com/how-much-money-can-you-make-selling-online-courses/">how much you want or need to earn</a> from the course. Do you need to cover costs to break even? Do you have an income goal? What is the total amount of revenue you expect to earn?</li><li><strong>Conversion. </strong>How many people in your potential audience do you expect to actually purchase the course? Using data from your email list, social media following, landing pages, or other campaign information, you can come up with an estimated conversion rate for your audience. This rate should be a percentage represented in a decimal: For example, if you expect 10% of your audience to convert, use 0.10 in the formula below.</li></ul>



<p>Now you’re ready to try out the formula:</p>



<p><strong>Revenue = Audience Size x Conversion Rate x Price</strong></p>



<p>Plug in different numbers to see how the course price changes based on your revenue goals, or how revenue increases or decreases at different course price points and conversion rates.</p>



<p>The optimal course price is one that allows you to meet your revenue goals given your audience size and estimated conversion rate.</p>



<h2>Reach your goals while staying grounded</h2>



<p>The final element of pricing strategy is ensuring that course content aligns with the price. If you use the formula and it suggests an exorbitant course price, you might need to reconsider your goals; it’s unreasonable to charge $10,000 for 10 minutes of information, for example.</p>



<p>Ultimately, thinking about the different pricing models with the pricing formula as a guide will help you choose a pricing strategy that works for you and for your customer base.</p>

<p>Content is done, promotions are ready, and the last item on your pre-launch checklist is how to price an online course so that people will sign up. Pricing can be one of the trickiest elements of launching a new course online because it is a balance of finding that sweet spot of providing value to your target audience at a price they’re willing to pay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appropriate online course building and pricing can help a content creator make the move from a side gig to full-time work. Well-developed online courses can drive revenue and even sponsorships for your website or brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to get started? Here are some pricing considerations to think about before launching a new online course.</p>



<h2 id="h-pricing-online-courses-starts-with-course-types"><strong>Pricing Online Courses Starts with Course Types</strong></h2>



<p>Online course expert <a href="https://sarahcordiner.com/price-online-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Cordiner</a> says that all content falls into one of five types of online courses. Of course, the type you plan to offer can correlate to value and pricing strategy. It’s important for content creators to keep this in mind as they develop online courses.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Lead Magnet Mini-Course:</strong> Generally, this is a free and short online course that helps get people interested in greater content. The mini-course may be the first lesson of a more comprehensive paid course that serves as a marketing lead.</li><li><strong>Kickstarter Course:</strong> These courses are a gateway for content creators into course development. These online courses might mimic other content you are creating, such as a how-to blog post series, in a different format. These courses are often low-priced (less than $100), aren’t long in duration (can be completed in a few minutes to an hour), and are ideal for creators that already have credibility and followers.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Authority Flagship Course:</strong> When you think of online courses, the Authority Flagship Model is probably what comes to mind first. These are courses with an established instructor that’s got plenty of credibility in their field, are moderately priced ($100 to $3,000), and include repeat logins or sessions (lasting about one hour each over several weeks). These courses include information that you can’t get elsewhere, such as a tutorial or in-depth explainer of a topic.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supportive Coach-Lead Course:</strong> The content may be similar to an Authority Flagship Course, but the delivery is different. These courses are designed for self-study and independent, rather than mass, learning with touchpoints with the instructor. These online courses are higher-priced ($500 and up), include multiple sessions and one-on-one meetings, and plenty of information to help you succeed individually.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Membership or Online Academy Course:</strong> This group class is structured with multiple classes in a series that build on one another. Students might participate in different tracks to earn credentials or certifications. The pricing strategy is less about the cost of an individual course, but for the module as a whole using a subscription-based model ($10 to $100 per month).&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>No matter which online course strategy you choose, you need to <a href="https://myelearningworld.com/how-to-price-your-online-course/">do your homework</a> to ensure that you are developing a course that people will want to take. It starts with research, audience understanding, marketing, and content development.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-pricing-models-for-online-courses"><strong>4 Pricing Models for Online Courses</strong></h2>



<p>Once you have developed a course and know what type of class you’ll offer, it’s time to really start thinking about pricing. There are four true tiers of online course pricing: free, baseline, and premium.</p>



<h3 id="h-free-courses">Free courses</h3>



<p>Free courses are a great tool to help drive business and get people interested in the course content you have to offer. A <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-free-course-content-to-drive-more-business/">free course</a> or sample lesson can also serve as a test strategy for something you plan to evolve or further develop as a paid course later.</p>



<h3 id="h-baseline-courses">Baseline courses</h3>



<p>Baseline courses reach a wide audience with content that appeals to a lot of people at an economical price point. These courses should be quick to create, not involve huge participant time commitments, and include topics or information that goes in-depth, but doesn’t get too technical. These courses may result in a lot of signups with low participation because of the low-risk price point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you give a coupon for a free class, the completion rate can be in the low single digits. When you charge for the same course, the completion rate can be 30% or 40%. The more you charge for a course, the more people actually complete it,” <a href="https://convertkit.com/how-to-price-your-online-course">said Ankur Nagpal, CEO and founder of Teachable</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-premium-courses">Premium courses</h3>



<p>Premium online courses are the goal for most content creators when they are thinking about pricing strategy. These courses have the highest price points but must deliver high-quality content at the same time. Course material must be unique, have a well-known instructor, or be something that you can’t get anywhere else to justify the price point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of a premium online course as being on par with a university-level experience or led by a “celebrity” in a masterclass format. These courses won’t garner as many signups as baseline courses but often have high participation and engagement rates.</p>



<h3>Subscription model</h3>



<p>Subscription model courses offer membership payment options for your customers. This can be in the form of daily, weekly, monthly, or annual subscriptions. Once a member, your customer gets access to your gated content.</p>



<h2><strong>Online Course Pricing Strategy</strong></h2>



<p>One of the best formulas for pricing online courses comes from <a href="https://onlinecourseigniter.com/how-much-money-can-you-make-from-an-online-course/">Online Course Igniter</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It starts with a little audience research so that you know how many people could potentially be interested in your online course. This audience could change for every new course, depending on the content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, you’ll want to think about how much money you want or need to make from the course. Do you have costs that you need to cover to break even? Do you have a set goal for income from each online course?</p>



<p>Then you are going to take a deep dive into your audience analytics. At this point, you probably have an email list, social media following, landing page, or another method to collect and interact with people who are interested in your content. What you need to determine is how interested they are to come up with an average conversion rate for that audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then you can plug all the data into the basic formula to determine pricing and revenue:</p>



<p><strong>Revenue = Audience Size x Conversion Rate x Price</strong></p>



<p>Don’t forget to subtract any costs from revenue to <a href="https://www.learnworlds.com/how-much-money-can-you-make-selling-online-courses/">determine actual profit</a> on the online courses you create.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final element of pricing strategy is ensuring that course content aligns with the price. It’s unreasonable to ask someone to pay $1,000 for 10 minutes of information. Thinking about pricing models and perceived value will help you choose a pricing strategy that works for your customer base.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Much Should You Charge for an Online Course?</strong></h2>



<p>So, it all comes back to the central question: How much should you charge for an online course?</p>



<p>Thinking about course type, pricing models, and then a full pricing strategy the answer may be more clear than you think. (You should at least narrow it to a range quickly.)</p>

<p>Creating your online course is only the first step of the journey.</p>



<p>You’ve spent good money and tons of hours to create a valuable course for your audience, but now, <em>how will you sell that course?</em></p>



<p>As a course creator, there are a few areas of marketing that are going to be crucial to the success of your online course.</p>



<p><em>SEO.</em></p>



<p><em>Content creation.</em></p>



<p><em>Email marketing.</em></p>



<p>But<strong> your email list is</strong> <strong>your bread and butter.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s where you capture and own your audience. Where you develop long-term relationships with your audience.&nbsp; Where you build trust with people.</p>



<p><em>And it’s where most people are likely to buy from you.</em> The best time to start your email list was a year ago, and the second-best time to start is NOW.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll dig into 7 ways you, as a course creator, can start growing your email list. Each of these 7 tactics we consider to be “lead generation tactics” and work best if followed up with an automated welcome sequence or sales sequence.</p>



<p>So why are these “lead generation tactics” so important for course creators?</p>



<p>Believe it or not, not everyone who lands on your website is ready to buy from you. Even those who are very interested in your course!</p>



<p>Most of the time, it takes a bit of nurturing and trust-building for folks to buy your courses or products. Your email list is the place where all of that happens!</p>



<p>And the best part?</p>



<p>When you create new courses or products, run special offers, or have new announcements — your email list is a captive audience of raving fans.</p>



<p>So let’s jump into these 7 Email List Building Tactics, so you can start selling more of your course!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-give-away-the-first-video-of-your-course-for-free"><strong>1. Give away the first video of your course…for free.</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s just go ahead and start with a bang.</p>



<p>Overcoming objections is a very common tactic in sales, and if you’re going to sell more of your course, you’ll need to anticipate your audience’s objections and head them off.</p>



<p>OBJECTION: If people are hesitant to buy your online course, it’s quite possible that they simply aren’t sure that the course is exactly what they need.</p>



<p>Giving away the first video of the course for free is a fantastic way to <strong>overcome that objection</strong> and show people that your course is <em>exactly the thing they need</em> to solve whatever problem they’re experiencing.</p>



<p>Or, it proves that the course isn’t what they need.</p>



<p>Either way, by giving away the first part of your course for free, you become etched as a trustworthy and generous brand in the mind of your audience — and that goes a long way.</p>



<p>P.S. If you’re worried about giving too much away for free, remember that the first video of your course is only a sample. It’s likely that they can’t really do anything without the entire course curriculum, right?</p>



<p>So be generous and give that first video away. I think you’ll be surprised to see the amount of sales that roll in from this little trick.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-create-a-free-video-course"><strong>2. Create a free video course.</strong></h3>



<p><em>MORE free stuff?!</em> You better believe it. Anyone who has been to Costco on a Sunday knows that we love freebies.</p>



<p>But before you get too worked up about creating ANOTHER course (and giving it away for free nonetheless), let me explain a little.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>*This free course does not have to be highly produced, and it doesn’t have to be long.*</strong></p>



<p>It just has to be valuable, aligned with your audience’s aspirational identity, and delivered via email over a set number of days.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.brandbuildersgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brand Builders Group</a> does a great job with this in their free course <a href="http://firststeptofamous.com/jf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“First Step to Famous.”</a></p>



<p>When someone opts in for the free course, they immediately receive the first video of the series in their inbox.</p>



<p>Then, over the next few days, the rest of the free course is delivered via email one video per day, with each video creating enough intrigue to prompt viewers back to the inbox the next day.</p>



<p>And at the end of the free video series?</p>



<p>You pitch your paid course, of course.</p>



<p>The benefits of giving away a free course are enormous. Not only is it attractive for your audience to get free content, in the process you simultaneously build trust with your audience AND you subconsciously train them to look for value every time they see your name pop up in the inbox.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-give-away-a-cheatsheet-or-checklist"><strong>3. Give away a “Cheatsheet” or “Checklist”.</strong></h3>



<p>I think classic whitepapers and PDFs are dying out. BUT…this does not mean that downloadable offers are irrelevant.</p>



<p>With so much information readily available from a quick Google search, we are less likely to give up our email addresses for information.</p>



<p><strong>We will, however, give up an email address for organization and application</strong>.</p>



<p>When you create a downloadable offer, make sure that it’s something your prospects can actually use. If your offer is just information, there’s a solid chance it will collect dust in the back corners of their Macbook.</p>



<p>Checklists and cheatsheets are two great ways to compile useful information into something more tangible.</p>



<p>Think “The Project Manager’s Ultimate Kickoff Meeting Checklist”, or “The Mama’s Cheatsheet to Daytime Naps”.</p>



<p>Instead of just giving information, create an offer that will be used daily and that is not likely to be found in a quick Google search.</p>



<p>Set up your Cheatsheet or Checklist with a pop up on your website and watch the leads roll in!</p>



<h3 id="h-4-start-a-newsletter"><strong>4. Start A Newsletter.</strong></h3>



<p>“Newsletters are dead, Jeff.”</p>



<p>False &amp; erroneous. Newsletters that just talk about your company ARE dead. Newsletters that talk about the reader are NOT.</p>



<p>A common mistake that people make with email newsletters is turning them into company bulletin boards.</p>



<p><em>“Check out our company picnic.</em></p>



<p><em>Here are our new hires.<br>Here’s a word from our president.”</em></p>



<p>I agree, nobody gives a rip about those newsletters.</p>



<p><strong><em>What people will sign up for, however, is regular content that makes their lives better.</em></strong></p>



<p>Enter the lead generating newsletter.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoolist.com/best-newsletters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brands like these ones&nbsp;</a>are roping in new subscribers by the thousands to their daily, weekly, or monthly newsletters.</p>



<p>The keys to creating a successful newsletter, though, are that the theme has to <strong>be aspirational to the audience it&#8217;s trying to reach</strong>, and the <strong>content has to be extremely valuable</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, creating a desirable newsletter such as this requires an intimate knowledge of your audience.</p>



<p>The better you know your target audience, the more likely you can strike gold with a regular newsletter that <em>your prospects can’t wait to sign up for.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-5-create-a-quiz"><strong>5. Create a Quiz.</strong></h3>



<p>Quizzes have long been known as effective lead generators. But the statistics are truly staggering.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActiveCampaign</a> found that quizzes can generate up to <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/5-secrets-to-using-quizzes-lead-generation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25x more leads</a> than a standard popup offering a PDF!</p>



<p>Similar to the newsletter, quizzes that tap into an aspirational identity with the target audience perform even better.</p>



<p>We are naturally curious and love to learn new things about ourselves and quizzes allow us to do that.</p>



<p>The brilliance of including a quiz as part of your lead generation strategy is that it creates an environment of engagement right from the get-go.</p>



<p>The more you engage your audience at the beginning of your relationship with them, the more likely it is that they will continue to engage with your brand in the future and respond to well-targeted offers.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-put-on-a-webinar"><strong>6. Put on a Webinar.</strong></h3>



<p>Webinars have quickly become one of the more popular lead generation tools in the last few years.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because they’re interactive, they establish you as a trusted authority, and <em>the leads are usually pretty warm</em>.</p>



<p>As the e-learning market grows, the amount of time we spend consuming webinars has <a href="https://on24.drift.click/c053a93b-23d9-42c6-b0e9-e92d536977a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased nearly 3x</a>, as well.</p>



<p>Webinars work especially well for launching a new course. According to Podia, 53% of marketers say that webinars generate the most high quality top-of-funnel leads, and as many as 40% of webinar attendees become qualified leads.</p>



<p>These are significant numbers, and prove how highly effective webinars can be to selling your new courses right out of the gate.</p>



<p>When your new course is ready to launch, set up a free webinar to introduce the course, teach a section of the course, or teach something related to the course topic.</p>



<p>Then, broadcast an announcement for the webinar across your social channels and on your website to invite people to attend.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-offer-a-discount"><strong>7. Offer a Discount.</strong></h3>



<p>I don’t recommend a discount for everyone, and some brands just aren’t into that kind of thing.</p>



<p><em>The only times</em> I would really suggest a discount is the launch of your brand, the launch of a new course, or around special holidays.</p>



<p>Needless to say…</p>



<p>Discounts have a way of piquing our interest and introducing a sense of urgency in a way that nothing else can.</p>



<p>It’s a double-edged sword, though. If you offer discounts too often, they just become noise and people will start to expect discounts or wait for your next discount to purchase your courses.</p>



<p>When you need a little momentum, say at the launch of a course, offering a discount just might be the best way to inject a little jet fuel and get things rockin’ and rollin’.</p>



<p>Just make sure you require people to opt-in with an email address to receive the discount code!</p>



<h3 id="h-final-words"><strong>Final Words</strong></h3>



<p>Building an audience can be challenging.</p>



<p>Finding the right strategy for generating leads onto your email list sometimes takes making educated guesses and iteration after iteration.</p>



<p>You might not get it just right the first time. But the truth is, <em>one well-working funnel can change your life.</em></p>



<p>Find the right lead generation tactic that works for you, your brand, and your audience,&nbsp;</p>



<p>attach a sales sequence to it,&nbsp;and set up a monthly <a href="http://www.contentremedy.co/blog/simple-email-marketing-strategy">broadcast strategy</a> to stay top of mind with your audience.</p>

<p>Many customers expect the option to try before they buy when considering a purchase—after all, most of us wouldn’t drive off the lot in a new car without taking it for a test drive first.</p>



<p>The same can be true for students considering enrolling in your online courses. Even though <em>you </em>know your content is top-notch, a new customer might not be convinced before seeing it for themself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By offering some of your course content for free, you can give prospective students a taste of the class before they move forward with a purchase. If giving away the goods seems counterintuitive, rest assured: Offering a freebie doesn’t mean you’re leaving money on the table. In fact, it could lead to <em>more </em>revenue by attracting a greater number of students to try out your courses and ultimately make a purchase.</p>



<p>Ready to use free course content to strengthen your business and increase sales? Here are a few ways to get started.</p>



<h2 id="h-offer-a-sample-lesson"><strong>Offer a sample lesson</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s say you sell online Italian courses. Maybe a prospective student isn’t sure they’ll be self-motivated or engaged enough to stick to the lessons. By offering a sample lesson of your beginner’s course, students can make sure the class structure and approach is a good fit for the way they learn—then they’ll be ready to buy the full course.</p>



<p>With a tool like LearnDash, you can easily create free <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/sample-lessons/">sample lessons</a>. Simply toggle a switch in your lesson&nbsp; settings to open up the lesson of your choice to anyone who’s interested.</p>



<h2><strong>Unlock a paid course</strong></h2>



<p>If a sample lesson is the amuse-bouche that gives students a taste of your content, unlocking a paid course is like handing out a free lunch.</p>



<p>This generous freebie allows prospective customers to go deeper into your content than what they’d experience in a sample lesson. Maybe they even take a few <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/quizzes/">quizzes</a> and watch some video content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a robust course catalog, opening up a whole course for free can be an effective way to familiarize students with your content before they buy additional courses. This approach also works well if your courses are structured in a progression: For example, you might unlock the first course in a series, then students can purchase subsequent courses to take their knowledge to the next level.</p>



<p><strong><em>Tip: </em></strong><em>Already have a YouTube playlist that you’re ready to repackage as a free course? Use the </em><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/courses/course-create-wizard/"><em>Course Create Wizard</em></a><em> in LearnDash to create an entire course from a playlist URL.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Think beyond sales</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ungated-content-free">Gated content</a> isn’t just a marketing tool for white papers and ebooks. Whether you offer a sample lesson or an entire course for free, you can require students to register for free content. This allows you to collect their email addresses and build a high-quality <a href="https://www.learndash.com/email-marketing-best-practices-for-online-educators/">email marketing</a> list.</p>



<p>Ultimately, free course content can also generate powerful word-of-mouth marketing. You never know who might try a sample lesson and recommend your course to someone who becomes your next customer.</p>

<p><strong>Your course customers want your course but they don’t want to jump through hoops to buy it. Creating a seamless checkout experience will not only wow your customers but improve your conversion rates to increase your profits.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>At this point, you’ve probably already launched your course and you’re seeing a good amount of traffic. But that traffic isn’t translating into bigger numbers in your bank account due to an increased cart abandonment rate.</p>



<p>Currently, the <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">cart abandonment rate</a> for ecommerce sites is sitting at nearly 70% across the board with the culprit hiding within the checkout process. That sounds discouraging but there’s hope for your online courses and it starts with optimizing your sales funnel.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What’s a sales funnel?</strong></p>



<p>A sales funnel is just marketing jargon for your sales process. On the surface every ecommerce business model has a sales funnel that starts with capturing a prospective customer’s attention and nurturing them until they make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to selling your LearnDash courses, your sales funnel will need a few tweaks to create a smoother sales process for your customer that will encourage them to complete the checkout process. More checkout completions equals more conversions and that means more profits for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How to increase conversion rates on your LearnDash course checkout page with WooFunnels&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>LearnDash’s checkout process makes it super simple for your customers to checkout but sometimes you need a few extras to boost sales. This is where a sales funnel integration comes in handy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Out of the box, WooFunnels comes equipped with six pre-built pages: optin, optin confirmation,sales page,checkouts, one click upsell, and thank you pages. This makes designing your sales funnel easy so you can focus on more important things.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most important WooFunnel features.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>High-Converting Checkout Pages</strong></p>



<p>Checkout pages are fully customizable giving you the freedom to design the page however you want. It also gives you the option to create single or multi-step checkout pages.</p>



<p>The checkout experience for mobile and desktop are optimized to boost average order value (AOV). Use their order bumps feature to show unlimited&nbsp; bumps on the checkout. They can include cross-sells for faster shipping, other courses, memberships, and even subscriptions.</p>



<p><strong>One-Click Upsells</strong></p>



<p>If your course sales funnel isn’t seeing a ton of traffic, you can make the most of the traffic that you do get with upsells. You won’t even need to spend extra money on ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can set target based rules to show customers products they’re most likely to buy. This is based on the acceptance or rejection of the previous offer. Beyond the checkout page, you can even offer one click upsells to increase AOV.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Analytics &amp; Reporting</strong></p>



<p>Your funnel will continually need improving so having access to robust analytics and reporting is a huge bonus. Woofunnels reporting dashboard shows how your funnels are performing with real-time analytics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can see the view count and conversion rate of each funnel, track the revenue generated, compare the performance of funnels, and view detailed data for every contact.</p>



<p><strong>Diverse Page Builder Integrations</strong></p>



<p>WooFunnel integrates with Elementor, Divi, Oxygen, and Gutenberg. It has built-in modules and comes ready to import templates. Make use of the shortcodes to build with Thrive, Beaver Builder,or any builder of your choice.</p>



<p><strong>Built-In A/B Testing&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A/B testing software for funnels are pricey but you’ll need to determine which parts of your funnel are working. WooFunnels A/B testing can be set up in less than five minutes. You can run split tests and analyze headlines, copy, colors, buttons, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Hubspot,&nbsp;LearnDash is the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-lms-plugin">best LMS plugin for WordPress</a> so it’s no secret that we’re pretty good at what we do. But we’re always looking for better ways to deliver the best elearning tools to support our learners. This is why we recommend integrating WooCommerce with your LearnDash membership to extend your course capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll detail why the Woocommerce integration is the perfect choice to sell your courses. As a bonus, you’ll get a step-by-step walkthrough of how to install, set up, and use it for your site.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-woocommerce"><strong>What Is Woocommerce?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> is a fully customizable, WordPress plugin that allows you to convert your WordPress website into a fully functional eCommerce platform. The plugin allows you to sell anything online and that includes your LearnDash courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-1024x576.png" alt="How To Sell Your Online Courses With WooCommerce" class="wp-image-29668" srcset="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-300x169.png 300w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-768x432.png 768w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-1422x800.png 1422w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-500x281.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One of the biggest wins with WooCommerce is having the capability to build your store without restrictions on design or payment processors which makes it an ideal choice for course creators.</p>



<h2 id="h-reasons-to-use-woocommerce-with-learn-dash"><strong>Reasons To Use Woocommerce With Learn Dash</strong></h2>



<p>LearnDash is built to keep things simple for course creators but sometimes you may need more features to make your course site more robust when it comes to automation and user experience. The WooCommer plugin works as a collaborative plugin to increase the range of your LearnDash site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of WooCommerce’s most powerful features.</p>



<p><strong>Automation made simple</strong></p>



<p>For example the course <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/login-registration/learndash/">registration page for LearnDash</a> is simple enough to allow your learners to register for your course quickly. WooCommerce takes that to the next level with automatic course enrollment immediately after registering. This takes a few steps out of the registration process to improve user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, WooCommerce allows you to process automatic refunds if you should need them and automatic course removals when your learners cancel subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WooCommerce is a beast when it comes to automation and user experience and it’s the perfect addition to your LearnDash membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Extensive payment gateway options</strong></p>



<p>Out of the box, LearnDash comes equipped with a built-in payment gateway system that accepts payments from processors like Stripe or Paypal. Since WooCommerce is more focused on the “ecommerce” part it adds a ton of features to beef up the payments system on LearnDash.</p>



<p>With WooCommerce you get access to over <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=1023&amp;collections=product&amp;page=2">100+ payment gateways</a> like Apple Pay, Square, and AfterPay. This gives your prospective learners the power of choice by offering a variety of payment options.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-5-1024x576.png" alt="How To Sell Your Online Courses With WooCommerce" class="wp-image-29672" srcset="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-5-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-5-300x169.png 300w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-5-768x432.png 768w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-5-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-5-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-5-1422x800.png 1422w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-5-500x281.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Supports physical and digital products&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Since LearnDash was created for courses, it has the best option for you to sell your digital courses with ease. When you combine it with WooCommerce, it allows you to sell physical products as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By having dual product capabilities you can better support your course community by offering more products like physical books, merchandise, and even other digital products like webinars</p>



<p><strong>More creative control over the checkout process</strong></p>



<p>When you integrate WooCommerce with LearnDash, you gain more control over what your customer’s checkout experience will look and feel like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can choose to have a traditional checkout process where your courses and product are laid out in a grid-based format. This is best for selling multiple courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re more interested in increasing course sales, you can use a LearnDash add-on like <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/samcart/">SamCart </a>to get a sales funnel flow. By going this route, you’re able to streamline sales through a one-page checkout experience and include upsells and order bumps to help increase sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By adding WooCommerce, you can customize your product pages to make them more user and sales friendly. You can design your checkout pages to feel more like a sales page with testimonials and product guarantees or give your learners more control to edit their shopping carts with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Subscription and membership capabilities</strong></p>



<p>LearnDash comes with <a href="https://www.learndash.com/features/">subscription and membership </a>capabilities and they work to allow you to customize recurring payment schedules that include course bundles and multi-course access based memberships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WooCommerce expands on those capabilities with added features such as <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/?quid=0769b7cb5f6a9989f0202b3d44fa81a8">auto-renew subscriptions</a>, upgrades/downgrades, and free trial offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Customizable tax and coupon options</strong></p>



<p>Although WooCommerces isn’t a substitute for a tax professional, it has a tax automation feature that will lighten your accounting load.&nbsp; When you set up your WooCommerce account you can choose to have your taxes automatically calculated upon checkout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Custom coupons are also available. WooCommerce allows you to do things like create custom coupon codes to encourage new sign up and referral codes to reward your current learners for inviting new members.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-5-woocommerce-add-ons-and-extensions-to-use-with-learndash"><strong>Top 5 WooCommerce Add-ons and Extensions To Use With LearnDash&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>For additional features and functionality, WooCommerce has hundreds of extensions and over 1,000 plugins to fit whatever you need. Take your course site to the next level with our top 5 WooCommerce add-on and extension recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WooCommerce Payments</strong></p>



<p>To streamline your checkout process, you can use the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-payments/?quid=51620e77de0976cf7ec59037628c2a9f">Woocommerce Payments add-on</a>.&nbsp; Accept all major credit/ debit cards methods locally on your site with this fully integrated payments solution that allows you to keep your payments in one place.

<p>This add-on improves cart abandonment rates by eliminating the need for payment on a third-party website.</p>



<p><strong>Follow-Ups</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/follow-up-emails/?quid=c5cf3da1a6af2bc987ffa62e17e80ed3">Follow-Ups</a> add-on keeps learners engaged with less work and manual effort by allowing you to automate personalized, drip email campaigns. It can be used to check in with learners who are falling behind or missing course content and offer new courses to those who are interested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One notable feature is the integrated Twitter follow-up that automatically tweets learners when they buy or finish a course.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WooCommerce Instagram&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Do you promote your courses on Instagram?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-instagram/?quid=a453dbb0afa7c539d10f1b5553e0c7d8">WooCommerce Instagram</a> extension can boost course sales by allowing prospective learners to be redirected to your course page in one single click. It also helps you increase your visibility by defining product hashtags and allowing your audience to tag their images with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Affiliate for WooCommerce</strong></p>



<p>Courses are all about community. You can offer your community of loyal learners by making them course affiliates through your own affiliate program.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/affiliate-for-woocommerce/?quid=cec8fe4452e1856b55a067400905c268">Affiliate for WooCommerce</a> allows you to track referrals, sales, and commissions in addition to managing payouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>



<p>Before moving on to setting up WooCommerce, you need to <strong>disable guest checkout</strong>. All users will need to create an account when using this integration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Navigate to <strong>WOOCOMMERCE &gt; SETTINGS</strong></p>



<p>2. Click on the <strong>Accounts &amp; Privacy</strong> tab</p>



<p>3. Uncheck the box next to “Allow customers to place orders without an account”</p>



<p>4. On the same page, check the box next to “Allow customers to create an account during checkout”</p>



<p>5. Click<strong> Save Changes </strong>at the bottom</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-13-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-29685" srcset="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-13-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-13-300x169.png 300w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-13-768x432.png 768w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-13-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-13-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-13-1422x800.png 1422w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-13-500x281.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Next, you’ll need to create a product in WooCommerce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Navigate to <strong>PRODUCTS &gt; ADD NEW</strong></p>



<p>2. Fill in the appropriate information for your product (see WooCommerce’s guide on <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/">managing products</a>)</p>



<p>3. Scroll down to the<strong> Product data</strong> section</p>



<p>5. Check the box for <strong>Virtual</strong> next to the Simple Product dropdown menu</p>



<p>6. Open the <strong>Simple Product</strong> dropdown menu and choose <strong>Course</strong></p>



<p>7. Next to <strong>Related Courses</strong>, click on the course you’d like to associate with this product</p>



<p>8. Click <strong>Publish </strong>or <strong>Update</strong> when you’re finished</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-16-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-29688" srcset="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-16-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-16-300x169.png 300w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-16-768x432.png 768w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-16-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-16-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-16-1422x800.png 1422w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-16-500x281.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>After your product is set up in WooCommerce, you’ll need to adjust your LearnDash course.</p>



<p>1. Navigate to <strong>LEARNDASH LMS &gt; COURSES</strong></p>



<p>2. Click on the course that corresponds with a WooCommerce product</p>



<p>3. Click the <strong>Settings </strong>tab at the top</p>



<p>4. Under <strong>Course Access Settings</strong>, look for <strong>Access Mode</strong> and set this to Closed</p>



<p>5. In the <strong>Button URL</strong> field, enter the URL to your WooCommerce product page</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-17-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-29689" srcset="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-17-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-17-300x169.png 300w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-17-768x432.png 768w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-17-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-17-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-17-1422x800.png 1422w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-17-500x281.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2 id="h-have-you-built-your-sales-page-yet">Have You Built Your Sales Page Yet?</h2>



<p>If you are focused on selling your online course one of the final things you have to do before launch is creating your sales page. Late last year I discovered a sales page that I liked and never had the time to circle back and break it down.</p>



<p>So today I&#8217;m going to show you&nbsp;<a href="https://minimumviablevideo.carrd.co/">Minimum Viable Video</a>&nbsp;and their sales page.</p>



<p>Now, before I get started, I should let you know, there are twenty parts to this page. That&#8217;s a lot of parts. You can likely get away with a bit less, but it was done so well, I felt like you need to see the whole thing executed so brilliantly.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s jump in…</p>



<h2>Part One: Let&#8217;s Start with the Hero</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/1.salespage-hero-1024x503.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59512"/></figure>



<p>There are two things I really like about this hero area.</p>



<p><strong>The first is that line above the headline, because it tells us who it is for</strong>. The worst thing you can do is let readers spend minutes going over your offering before figuring out it&#8217;s not for them.</p>



<p><strong>The second is that they&#8217;re connecting what&#8217;s being taught with how you can put it to work</strong>. In other words, even from the very start, Cam is telling us why we should take this course.</p>



<h2>Part Two: The Introduction</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/2.salespage-intro-1024x587.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59513"/></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re selling your online course with a sales page, one of the hardest parts you&#8217;ll likely have is the “talking about yourself” part. But this intro is done really well because it&#8217;s not the “about me” kind of section. Instead, this intro connects you to a real person, highlights that they know what they&#8217;re doing, and connects you (again) to the benefits / results that this course offers.</p>



<h2>Part Three: Don&#8217;t Be Afraid of Words</h2>



<p>One of my buddies,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JustinWise">Justin</a>, once shared an insight from all this work with Facebook Ads. He said that long ads were better (financially) than short ones. Not that short ones didn&#8217;t send more traffic. But that longer ones qualified the traffic better because the people who read the longer ones converted better (when it came time to make a purchase).</p>



<p>In this example, look at all the words that Cam is using to agitate the challenge. He&#8217;s not pushing deep into pain. But he&#8217;s stirring it up.</p>



<p>And he&#8217;s not afraid to use words, lots of them, to do it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/3.salespage-agitate-438x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59514"/></figure>



<h2>Part Four: Benefits as Imagine Statements</h2>



<p>What I love about this next section is that they are all benefits but done as imagine statements. What could you do and accomplish, if you were comfortable doing XX? Let me list all the ways.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/4.salespage-imagine-858x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59515"/></figure>



<h2>Part Five: Dealing with the Challenges</h2>



<p>Now, in this next section, Cam isn&#8217;t dealing with the buying challenges. He&#8217;s not working past your initial conflict over whether to sign up. Instead, he&#8217;s directly attacking the challenges you have with the problem his course is solving.</p>



<p>In other words, he&#8217;s demonstrating his expertise by dealing with your stress in a relatable way that makes you want to sign up and get more of this from him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/5.Salespage-challenges-798x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59516"/></figure>



<h2>Part Six: What&#8217;s Included in the Course</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re selling your online course you&#8217;re eventually going to get to the point where you have to tell people what they&#8217;re going to get. I really like how Cam sets this up. Again, there&#8217;s a lot of insight into how he&#8217;s shaping his content – focusing on benefits even as he&#8217;s telling you what you&#8217;ll get.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/6.salespage-included-1024x965.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59517"/></figure>



<h2>Part Seven: Testimonials</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve told you&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/video-testimonials/">how important testimonials</a>&nbsp;are. Well, you&#8217;ll see them here doing a superb job of convincing you to sign up for the course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/7.salespage-testimonials-1024x271.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59518"/></figure>



<h2>Part Eight: The Instructor</h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;re halfway into this page, it&#8217;s time to introduce you to the author and instructor of the course. But not just his name, but rather his history and qualifications to teach you what he&#8217;s going to teach.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/8.salespage-instructor-1024x695.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59519"/></figure>



<h2>Part Nine: The Course</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/9.salespage-course-1024x711.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59520"/></figure>



<p>Notice that this is the first time you get the course name. And even then, you&#8217;re getting a description of the course without getting the low-level details of the course. Normally we jump too quickly into the details before we&#8217;ve really made sure our reader / prospect is interested. And when they&#8217;re not, they skim past it.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve heard the “leave them wanting more,” well that&#8217;s how this is done.</p>



<h2>Part Ten: More Testimonials</h2>



<p>I don&#8217;t think you need another screenshot of this section. There will be more sections of testimonials. But I do like that the earlier section was text and three columns, and this one is text and two columns.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re likely thinking I would improve this to get video testimonials, but just you wait, he&#8217;ll get there.</p>



<h2>Part Eleven: Course Details</h2>



<p>Now we get to the actual course details. Notice that it starts with what the course isn&#8217;t and then moves into what it is. The focus is on effort, yours as a student, and not just a list of videos.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/11.salespage-coursedetails-782x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59522"/></figure>



<h2>Part Twelve: Video Testimonial</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/12.salespage-videotestimonial-1024x633.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59523"/></figure>



<p>Now we see the introduction (but not the final use) of video testimonials. I think they&#8217;re the best way to close the deal – because they&#8217;re high fidelity.</p>



<p>What you&#8217;ll notice if you watch the videos is that they&#8217;ve been tweaked to add call outs so that the viewer knows what to pay attention to.</p>



<h2>Part Thirteen: What You&#8217;ll Learn</h2>



<p>My favorite line on this whole page is the data-driven articulation of what you&#8217;ll learn in this course. Here is it, “<strong>Students in our previous cohort published over 100 videos combined and improved their skills by 68%.</strong>“</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a powerful way to articulate what you&#8217;ll learn in this course. Because it&#8217;s a data point, it&#8217;s factual, and it&#8217;s a result (not just part of the process).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/13.salespage-whatyoulllearn-911x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59524"/></figure>



<h2>Part Fourteen: Corporate Testimonials</h2>



<p>What I like about section fourteen is that it&#8217;s not just more testimonials. These are different. They&#8217;re corporate testimonials. And that&#8217;s powerful because you get to use those logos from companies you know and trust. It&#8217;s more powerful than just saying that you&#8217;ve helped individuals, small businesses and corporations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/14.salespage-corptestimonials-894x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59525"/></figure>



<h2>Part Fifteen: The Schedule</h2>



<p>It took us getting to part fifteen to see the actual contents of the course. I told you in part nine that they were leaving us wanting more. Well now we&#8217;re here and we get to see the details of the course via their schedule.</p>



<p>Everyone selling their course online will do well to see how slowly they got here.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/15.salespage-schedule-785x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59526"/></figure>



<h2>Part Sixteen: The Results</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/16.salespage-results-1024x906.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59527"/></figure>



<p>By now you realize that this course is a practical one with assignments. It&#8217;s a&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/theres-a-shift-in-elearning/">cohort-based learning course</a>&nbsp;that when completed will leave you with several artifacts that you can use after graduation. So showing you what you leave with is a powerful way to get you to sign up.</p>



<h2>Part Seventeen: Guarantee</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/17.salespage-guarantee-1024x401.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59529"/></figure>



<p>This is the kind of “money back guarantee” that I recommend to anyone I&#8217;m talking to about selling a course. It&#8217;s the “you have to show me you attended and put in the work, and if you&#8217;re still unsatisfied…” kind of approach.</p>



<p>I absolutely love it!</p>



<h2>Part Eighteen: More Video Testimonials</h2>



<p>Yes, even more testimonials. But you knew that was coming right?</p>



<h2>Part Nineteen: How To Know You&#8217;re Ready</h2>



<p>A section I don&#8217;t see enough on sales pages is this “how to know if you&#8217;re ready” kind of page. It&#8217;s an easy way to let prospects qualify and disqualify themselves without a lot of effort.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/19.salespage-ready-971x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59530"/></figure>



<h2>Part Twenty: FAQs</h2>



<p>The final section before another “enroll” now section, which is available in several places on the page, is the FAQ section. The biggest benefit to how these FAQs are designed is that they&#8217;re shaped to mitigate the most common reasons people stop themselves from buying the course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/20.salespage-faq-1024x1005.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59531"/></figure>



<h2>Selling Your Online Course? Always Look For Examples</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re getting ready to sell your online course, my recommendation is always the same – look for examples you like. Take screenshots, save them, and bookmark pages – all so you can come back and dig into them. Take what you like and use it as a model. Skip what doesn&#8217;t work for you.</p>



<p>But learn from everyone because doing this alone and from scratch is hard.</p>
