Step-by-step tutorial guide, web or new feature intro tour (MULTI-PAGE) created intuitively with baked-in visual front-end builder and detail configuration on the admin board


== Description ==
You can create an intuitive tour that guides people through your website or co-workers to manage your website via the WordPress admin board. You can choose how and when your tour starts and how it looks and behaves. This is all possible without any special technical knowledge, as the plug-in integrates the Visual Builder. If you have deeper technical knowledge, you can benefit from the advanced configuration that allows you to set up the tour for special scenarios as well.

= Key Features =

**Free version of Intro Tour Tutorial Plugin**

* **Visual frontend builder**: You can create and edit all tour steps and also visually select the start element ( button ) directly in the frontend.
* **4 design themes (accent color adaptive)**: You can choose from multiple themes for styling presentational elements and choose the most suitable one to match the vibe of your web. You can also enable/disable the displaying of selected presentation elements. 
* **1 trigger configuration**: You can easily choose from a variety of options how and where the tour should start, whether a start is only required for the user's first visits and much more.
* **Smooth design**: The tour is designed to maintain the visitor's full attention without any "sharp breaks" in the story of the tour.
* **Smart tooltip positioning**: The best position for the tooltip is automatically found in each step to get the best responsive view on mobile. You can also set your preferred position for each step.
* **WPML translation**: You can translate your tours with a popular WPML plugin.


= PRO version of Intro Tour Tutorial Plugin =

**All features from the FREE version are included, some of them are extended and new features are added**

* **Multi-page tours**: Yes, you don't have to limit yourself to a one-page intro tour.
* **6 design themes (accent color adaptive)**:  üé® [Check all themes here](http://deeppresentation.com/plugins/dp-intro-tours/?dp-lock=start-theme-demo)
* **2 trigger configurations**: The FREE version already offers a wide range of options for configuring the tour start. In the PRO version, however, you can set up 2 trigger configurations simultaneously for each tour. This allows you to combine their settings and cover a variety of use cases. E.g. automatic start, but only on the first visit together with start when an info button is pressed.
* **URL variables**: Would you like your visitors to take a tour of pages with variable URLs, e.g. a tour of all product detail pages and their sub-pages with product ID in the URL, or public dashboards for users with user ID in the URL? In PRO you have the option to do this.
* **URL parameter lock - tour just for selected users**: You can send an introductory invitation to a tour for a specific person only by sending a tour URL with the unlock parameter. For the tour that starts on the home page: www.your-home-page-address.com/?dp-lock={Unlock key}.
* **Tour on WP admin board**: Would you like to offer your co-workers or those with access to web administration, an interactive guide to using your WordPress admin board and all the modules integrated there? In PRO, you can also easily create a tour on the admin board site.
* **Mobile / widescreen view**: In PRO, you can skip a step or even select a different target element, depending on whether the step is displayed on a cell phone or a bigger screen.
* **Mobile menu support**: You can also target mobile menu items so that the mobile menu automatically opens before that step during the tour. 
* **Shortcodes support in intro content**: You can insert WP shortcodes in intro tips and make the tour a much more complex tool
* **Priority support**: With the PRO version, you receive preferential support and updates. You can access the support forum to report any bugs.
