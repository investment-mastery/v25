Yes, PRO version provides multi-page tours and lot more functions.

Yes it does

You can use standard WordPress export/import to migrate tours WP Admin Board -> Tools -> Export / import

* **Where we find Selectors for intro steps and trigger?**
You don't need to have a tech knowledge of css selectors as you can use baked in frontend builder to specify selectors visually. But you have still option to set/adjust it manually if you prefer to.

* **Can we allow triggering of tour just for specific users?**
In PRO version, you can use lock by URL parameter feature, so if you want to send an intro tour invitation just for specific person, you can send him/her URL of tour's start (e.g. for tour starting on home page: www.your-home-page-address.com/<strong>?start-intro-tour={Unlock Key}</strong>).
